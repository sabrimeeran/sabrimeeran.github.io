    <h2>Speculation Demo</h2>

    <p>So I missed out of the Bitcoin boom in 2017 and 2021. This has motivated me to work out how much money I could have made.</p>

    <p>However, I don't think I could have timed it correctly, so I want to find out how much I could have earned if:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I bought into Bitcoin at a specific time</li>
        <li>I sold a percentage of my holdings each month/quarter/year</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Whilst I wouldn't maximize profits with this strategy, it could still allow for fairly high profits without the risk of losing<br />
        everything by selling too late. It is also probably better to speculate in many different cryptocurrencies/blockchain tokens etc.<br />
        since most coins - even the ones which seem plausible - will likely cause losses.
    </p>

    <p>
        I show an example with principal £100, monthly 3% withdrawals,<br />
        starting January 2019, ending April 2021 (when the entire holding is sold off)
