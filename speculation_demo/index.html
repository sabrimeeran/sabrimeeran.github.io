    <h2>Speculation Demo</h2>

    <p>So I missed out of the Bitcoin boom in 2017 and 2021. This has motivated me to work out how much money I could have made.</p>

    <p>However, I don't think I could have timed it correctly, so I want to find out how much I could have earned if:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I bought into Bitcoin at a specific time</li>
        <li>I sold a percentage of my holdings each month/quarter/year</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Whilst I wouldn't maximize profits with this strategy, it could still allow for fairly high profits without the risk of losing
        everything by selling too late. It is also probably better to speculate in many different cryptocurrencies/blockchain tokens etc.
        since most coins - even the ones which seem plausible - will likely cause losses.
