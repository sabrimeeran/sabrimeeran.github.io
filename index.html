    <h2>I haven't used HTML in ages-</h2>

    <p>I haven't! I know a bit of HTML, CSS &amp; JS, but I'll mostly be relearning it all as I write these pages!</p>

    <h3>What are you writing about?</h3>

    <p>Mostly economics, but really anything that seems fairly niche and fascinating. If you find anything I write
    worth engaging with, please do send me an email or comment - it'd be nice to learn something new, or perhaps
    make something new.</p>

    <h3>Can you give me some pointers?</h3>

    <p>Sure, as soon as I write something! I want to cover all sorts of stuff - religion and statistics and science
    and technology and economics models etc. etc., and I will try to give some examples of that below soon.</p>

    <p><a href="/2021/june/first/">2021 June 1st - 'How much inflation do we expect in the future?'</a></p>
    <p><a href="/2021/june/twelfth/">2021 June 12th - 'Will wage rises fuel inflation? And will the S&amp;P continue to rise?'
</a></p>

    <h3>How will you avoid procrastinating?</h3>

    <p>Tricky! I'll just have to treat this like homework. Also, it's nice to be 'producing' something, rather than 
    'consuming' e.g. watching TV or YouTube or reading a blog or a book or attending a lecture etc. Wish me luck</p>
