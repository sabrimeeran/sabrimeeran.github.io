    <h1><u>The question(s)</u></h1>
    <p>What rate of inflation should we prepare for in the future? And how?</p>

    <p>
        Economics is nothing if not unpredictable! What if we expect 5-year 3% 
        inflation, but instead inflation is as high as 4% or 5%? Should we not
        at least prepare for this possibility? We should start by asking how
        this may occur - what's different about today that could cause 
        prolonged higher inflation?
