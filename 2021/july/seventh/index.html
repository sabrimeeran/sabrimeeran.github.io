    <h1><u>The question(s)</u></h1>
    <p>What rate of inflation do we predict, using less conventional methods?</p>

    <h2><u>The components</u></h2>

    <p>
        To start with, we can use Mean Trimmed PCE inclusions and exclusions to find inflation data
        for individual components. We should first look at components where inflation &gt;10%. 
        It's a startlingly large percentage of the components - 17.84% - that are experiencing &gt;10%
        inflation! And it appears these components are contributing 23.4 percentage points
        to inflation (!)

    <p>
        One possibility is that accelerating inflation encourages supermarkets to ration
        essential items, which is similar to events during the toilet roll shortages and panic
        buying in early 2020. Online auction prices could be four to six times the retail price
        according to
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/16/ebay-urged-to-clamp-down-on-coronavirus-profiteering">the Guardian</a>.
        In this way, quantity control could reduce component price inflation, resulting in a lower
        CPI statistic. However, for many goods and services, rationing for the greater social good is not expected.
    </p>


    <h1><u>The theory</u></h1>

    <img src="Diag1Infl.png" width="536"/>

    <p>
        I, at first glance, think that we can use inflation data for items in the basket of goods and services over a reasonably
        short period of time to predict inflationary pressures which impact the inflation measure for the entire basket.
    </p>

    <h1><u>Approach</u></h1>

    <p>
        I thus needed data on <u>CPI</u> components at least stretching back to the 1970s. The methodology and components measured
        will differ somewhat over this stretch of time, but I could not predict a double-digit inflation rate without this data.
        Sadly, monthly component Excel data were only available back to 2012, and the news reports were only available back to 1994. 
        Thus, I decided to use FRED data for components and made sure the components chosen were generic enough to be available at
        least back to 1987, and mostly available to 1970.The components I chose were:
    </p>

        <ol>
            <li>FOOD AT HOME</li>
            <li>FOOD AWAY FROM HOME</li>

            <li>SHELTER</li>
            <li>APPAREL AND UPKEEP</li>
            <li>MEDICAL CARE COMMODITIES</li>
            <li>MEDICAL CARE SERVICES</li>

            <li>FUEL OIL & OTH HOUS. FUEL COM.</i>
            <li>MOTOR FUEL</li>
            <li>UTILITY (PIPED) GAS</li>
            <li>ELECTRICITY</li>

            <li>NEW VEHICLES</li>
            <li>USED CARS</li>
            <li>TRANSPORTATION SERVICES</li>

            <li>TOBACCO AND SMOKING PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</li>

        </ol>
    
    <p>
        Using 1987 weights, this covers 79.9% of CPI expenditure (less if there is overlap). I suspect 70-80% is the rough range it covers. The
        next task was to compile the data and make a CSV file for it. I used the following FRED data:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Food at Home in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAF11)</li>
        <li>Food Away from Home in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SEFV)</li>

        <li>Shelter in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAH1)</li>
        <li>Apparel in U.S. City Average (CPIAPPSL)</li>
        <li>Medical Care Commodities in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAM1)</li>
        <li>Medical Care Services in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAM2)</li>

        <li>Fuel Oil and Other Fuels in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SEHE)</li>
        <li>Motor Fuel in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SETB)</li>
        <li>Utility (Piped) Gas Service in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SEHF02)</li>
        <li>Electricity in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SEHF01)</li>

        <li>New Vehicles in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SETA01)</li>
        <li>Used Cars and Trucks in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SETA02)</li>
        <li>Transportation Services in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAS4)</li>

        <li><i>Tobacco and Smoking Products in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SEGA)</i></li>
        <li>Alcoholic Beverages in U.S. City Average (CUSR0000SAF116)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        I used component data starting in Dec 1969, except for Tobacco, where data were only available starting in Jan 1986.
        The next job was to compile the component weight data, starting in 1987 where it was available in text files. I was able
        to use Excel so that I could just paste the documents and the relevant weightings would be extracted - phew!
    </p>

    <p>I tried to use mathematical notation (or pseudo-mathemtical notation) first, before coding. This was a bit tedious, but
    made it easier to see mistakes, and, because it was quite difficult to write, pushed me to simplify the model:</p>
