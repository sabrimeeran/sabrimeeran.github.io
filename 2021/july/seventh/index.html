    <h1><u>The question(s)</u></h1>
    <p>What rate of inflation should we prepare for in the future? And how?</p>

    <p>
        Economics is nothing if not unpredictable! What if we expect 5-year 3% 
        inflation, but instead inflation is as high as 4% or 5%? Should we not
        at least prepare for this possibility? We should start by asking how
        this may occur - what's different about today that could cause 
        prolonged higher inflation?
    </p>

    <h2><u>The components</u></h2>

    <p>
        We can look at the Mean Trimmed PCE to find inflation data for individual
        components. I found similar data for CPI in the UK, which will be used later.
    </p>

    <p>We should first look at components where inflation &gt;10%, and decide what
    might be driving the incline, and how long these inflation rates might persist.
    First of all, it's a startlingly large percentage of the components - 17.84% - are
    experiencing &gt;10% inflation! And it appears these components are contributing
    23.4 percentage points to inflation (!)</p>
