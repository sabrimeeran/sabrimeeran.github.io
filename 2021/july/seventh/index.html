    <h1><u>The question(s)</u></h1>
    <p>What rate of inflation should we prepare for in the future? And how?</p>

    <p>
        Economics is nothing if not unpredictable! What if we expect 5-year 3% 
        inflation, but instead inflation is as high as 4% or 5%? Should we not
        at least prepare for this possibility? We should start by asking how
        this may occur - what's different about today that could cause 
        prolonged higher inflation?

    <h2><u>The components</u></h2>

    <p>
        We can look at the Mean Trimmed PCE to find inflation data for individual
        components. I found similar data for CPI in the UK, which will be used later.
    </p>

    <p>
        We should first look at components where inflation &gt;10%. It's a startlingly
        large percentage of the components - 17.84% - that are experiencing &gt;10% 
        inflation! And it appears these components are contributing 23.4 percentage points 
        to inflation (!)

    <p>
        One possibility is that accelerating inflation encourages supermarkets to ration 
        essential items, which is similar to events during the toilet roll shortages and panic
        buying in early 2020. Online auction prices could be four to six times the retail price
        according to 
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/16/ebay-urged-to-clamp-down-on-coronavirus-profiteering">the Guardian</a>.
        In this way, quantity control could reduce component price inflation, resulting in a lower
        CPI statistic.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, for many goods and services, rationing for the greater social good is not expected.
        For example, used car price inflation continues to rise, from _.
