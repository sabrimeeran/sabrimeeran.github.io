    <h2>The question</h2>
    <p>How much inflation do we expect in the future?</p>

    <h2>The approach</h2>
    <p>I can only guess at the answer, but I'd like to try to come up with an independent conclusion -
    which might be faulty or completely wrong. Nonetheless, I think it'll be fun to come up with an prediction,
    and to discuss inflation and costs of living more broadly, and see what we can learn along the way.</p>
    <p>Firstly, what is inflation?</p>

    <h2>Inflation definition</h2>

    <p>We might as well define terms! Encylopedia Britannica says 'inflation' is:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/inflation-economics">
        Inflation, in economics, collective increases in the supply of money, in money incomes, or in prices.
        Inflation is generally thought of as an inordinate rise in the general level of prices.
    </blockquote>

    <p>We might also wonder what central banks have to say - since they're responsible for keeping it under control,
    surely they should be the experts!</p>
