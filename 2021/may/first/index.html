    <h2>The question</h2>
    <p>How much inflation do we expect in the future?</p>

    <h2>The approach</h2>
    <p>I can only guess at the answer, but I'd like to try to come up with an independent conclusion -
    which might be faulty or completely wrong. Nonetheless, I think it'll be fun to come up with an prediction,
    and to discuss inflation and costs of living more broadly, and see what we can learn along the way.</p>
    <p>Firstly, what is inflation?</p>

    <h2>Inflation definition</h2>

    <p>We might as well define terms! Encylopedia Britannica says 'inflation' is:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/inflation-economics">
        collective increases in the supply of money, in money incomes, or in prices.
        Inflation is generally thought of as an inordinate rise in the general level of prices.
    </blockquote>

    <p>There are a few different measures of inflation. The Bank Of England used to use the Retail Price Index (RPI).
    The standard measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bank Of England now prefers CPIH, which includes housing costs
    based on what someone renting a home might pay. The Fed has adopted Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which accounts for a
    wider set of consumers.</p>

    <p>But</p>
